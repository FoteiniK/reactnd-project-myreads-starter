# MyReads Project

Seventh project for Udacity's FEND course.

## Project Overview
In the MyReads project, we'll create a bookshelf app that allows user to select and categorize books that has read, is currently reading, or want to read. The project emphasizes using React to build the application and provides an API server and client library that user will use to persist information as he/she interacts with the application.


## Getting Started

 Clone the repository or download the zip-file of the master branch.

### Prerequisites
 _npm_ :
 If you don't have npm installed, navigate to npm's [website](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) to download and install the software.

### Installing

To get started developing right away:
Using your terminal/command line, get inside the folder where these project files are kept: cd /path/to/the/project.

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`


## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
